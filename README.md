# Gridded-Turbulent-Source-Area

Purpose: Calculate and output gridded turbulent source areas following the Kormann and Meixner (2000) analytical source area model. 

In the case of a landscape with a homogenous distribution of sources (or sinks) at the surface, the gridded footprint function &phi; (x,y) shows the fraction of vertical turbulent flux originating from a cell (m^-2) representing a surface area. More generally, the grid cells show the vertical flux at the surface per unit point source (at the tower), when inverting time.

If the actual geographical distribution of sources (and sinks) in the source area are known, then the total flux measured at the tower is the sum over the product of footprint function and the grid cell's flux over all cells as illustrated here (see also Christen et al. 2011 for an example):

Individual source areas for one time step can be merged into a cumulative source area to create a source area climatology.

## Code

### Developer

#### fpr_kormann_and_meixner.pro

This routine calculates the flux source area ('footprint') in a gridded version based on the following inputs:

required inputs: 
*   z_0_input    : float. roughness length z0 of surface (in m)
*   z_m_input    : float. effective measurement height of flux system (in m) i.e. zm = (z-d)
*   u_input      : float. measured longitudinal wind velocity component (im m/s)
*   sig_v_input  : float. measured standard deviation of lateral wind velocity (im m/s)
*   L_input      : float. measured Obukhov length (in m)
   
optional inputs:
* x_max_input  : float. maximum distance the model grid should extend upwind of the sensor (default 1000 m)
* y_max_input  : float. maximum distance the model grid should extend lateral away from the centreline (default 500 m). Total domain in  y-direction is 2 x y_max_input (default 1000 m)
* d_input      : float. resultion of the grid-cells in m (default 5 m)

The numerical solve used to find the exponents of the power laws for the wind and eddy diffusivity profiles (Eq. 39 & 40 in Kormann & Meixner) works only for a typical range of input parameters. It is possible that no solution is found for a case.
